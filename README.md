# SE25 – Robot Simulation and Control System

![CI/CD Build Status](https://github.com/your-username/se25-robot-control/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **SE25 - Robot Simulation and Control System**, a project for the Project-Based Learning (PBL) course in Software Engineering.

The project involves the development of a real-time robotic simulation and control system, adhering to the ISO 12207 software life cycle processes and utilizing terminology from the IEEE Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).

## Core Technologies

- **Language:** C++ (using C++17 standard)
- **Middleware:** ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco
- **RT & Concurrency:** POSIX (pthreads)
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Version Control & PM:** Git & GitHub

## System of Interest (SoI) Overview

The System of Interest is a distributed system composed of two primary components: a **Simulation System** and a **Control Interface**. These components communicate in real-time to simulate a 6-axis robotic arm in a 3D environment and allow for its control through a user interface.

### System Architecture

The following SysML v2 diagram illustrates the high-level structure and the primary data flows of the system:

### Key Operational Scenarios

The system is designed to fulfill the following core operational scenarios:

1.  **System Initialization and Robot Loading:** The user launches the system, which loads a 3D model of a robotic arm into a virtual world and establishes a connection between the simulation and the control interface.
2.  **Manual Control:** The user manually controls the individual joints of the robotic arm in real-time via the control interface.
3.  **Automated Path Execution:** The user defines a sequence of target poses, and the system calculates and executes a smooth trajectory for the robot to follow.
4.  **Fault Detection and Response:** The system detects a collision in the simulation, immediately halts the robot's motion, and notifies the user.

## Project Structure

This repository is structured as a ROS 2 workspace. All custom packages are located within the `src` directory.

```
/se25_robot_control
├── src/
│   ├── simulation_pkg/      # ROS 2 package for the simulation environment
│   └── control_pkg/         # ROS 2 package for the control interface and GUI
├── docs/
│   ├── SRS.md               # System Requirements Specification
│   ├── ADD.md               # Architectural Design Document
│   └── images/              # Contains diagrams for documentation
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Development Environment Setup

To ensure a consistent development environment for all team members, please follow these setup instructions carefully on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.

### 1. Install Core Dependencies

First, install Git, GCC compiler, and CMake.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake
```

### 2. Install ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco

Follow the official ROS 2 documentation to install the **ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco** `ros-desktop` version.

[Official ROS 2 Jazzy Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html)

The key installation command is:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-desktop
```

After installation, remember to source the setup file in your shell:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Clone and Build the Project

1.  **Create a Colcon Workspace:**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
    cd ~/ros2_ws/
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Clone this repository into your workspace's `src` directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/se25-robot-control.git src/se25_robot_control
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies and Build:**
    Use `rosdep` to install any package dependencies and `colcon` to build the workspace.
    ```bash
    rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro jazzy -y
    colcon build
    ```

4.  **Source the Workspace:**
    Finally, source your local workspace's setup file. Add this to your `.bashrc` for convenience.
    ```bash
    echo "source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

## Usage

After successfully building the project, you can launch the full system using the provided ROS 2 launch file.

1.  Open a new terminal.
2.  Source your workspace: `source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash`
3.  Launch the system:
    ```bash
    ros2 launch control_pkg full_system_launch.py
    ```

## Project Management

This project is managed using **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Projects**. This keeps our tasks, discussions, and code all in one place.

-   **[Issues Tab](https://github.com/MII-IS/SE25/issues):** All requirements, tasks, bugs, and feature requests are tracked as issues.
-   **[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/MII-IS/projects/1):** A Kanban-style board is used to visualize the workflow and track the status of each issue. The columns are: `Backlog`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`.

## Contribution Workflow

All code contributions must be made through **Pull Requests (PRs)** to ensure code quality and maintain a stable `develop` branch.

1.  **Create/Assign an Issue:** Before starting work, make sure there is an issue that describes the task. Assign it to yourself.
2.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Create a new branch from the `develop` branch. Name it according to the feature or issue (e.g., `feature/REQ-FUN-006-path-execution`).
3.  **Implement and Test:** Write your code and include necessary unit tests. Ensure all tests pass locally.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Push your branch to GitHub and open a pull request to merge it into the `develop` branch. Link the PR to the issue it resolves.
5.  **Request a Review:** Assign at least one other team member to review your code. Discuss any feedback and make necessary changes.
6.  **Merge:** Once the PR is approved and all checks have passed, it can be merged into `develop`.
