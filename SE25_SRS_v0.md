## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system will act as a standalone 3D simulation platform. The SE25 system is designed as a **distributed real-time robotic simulation and control platform**. It consists of two interconnected subsystems:  
1. **Simulation Environment:**  
   - Built with a physics engine capable of simulating realistic robotic arm kinematics and dynamics.  
   - Provides a 3D rendering of the robot and its environment.  
   - Responsible for collision detection and state publishing.  
2. **Control Workstation:**  
   - Provides a GUI for user interaction.  
   - Sends manual and automated commands to the simulation.  
   - Receives and displays the robot’s current state in real time.  

The communication between these subsystems is implemented using **ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco**, enabling a modular publish–subscribe architecture. For example:  
- `/RobotState` topic: simulation publishes joint positions and end-effector pose.  
- `/ControlCommands` topic: control interface sends joint commands to the simulation.  

Thus, the system integrates **simulation accuracy** with **user interactivity** while adhering to real-time performance constraints.

### 2.2 Product Functions
At a high level, the SE25 system will provide the following functions:
- **System Initialization:** Load the robotic arm model (URDF) into the simulation environment.  
- **Manual Control:** Allow users to jog individual joints of the robotic arm via the GUI.  
- **Automated Path Execution:** Accept a sequence of target poses and execute them as trajectories in the simulation.  
- **Collision Detection:** Identify collisions between the robotic arm and environment obstacles.  
- **Emergency Response:** Halt motion immediately upon collision or detected fault.  
- **Visualization:** Display real-time robot pose and environment state to the user.   

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The system is intended for three primary categories of stakeholders:  
- **Students (Developers):**  
  - Background: Undergraduate software engineering students.  
  - Need: A clear, structured project that allows them to apply concepts from ISO 12207, real-time programming, and software engineering best practices.  
- **Instructor (Customer):**  
  - Role: Defines the project requirements and evaluates deliverables.  
  - Need: A project that fulfills course objectives, ensures traceability of requirements, and demonstrates applied knowledge.  
- **End-User (Hypothetical Researcher):**  
  - Background: Robotics researcher.  
  - Need: A reliable, flexible, and user-friendly tool for testing control algorithms without requiring physical robots.  

### 2.4 Operational Scenarios
The scenarios to take into consideration are the following:
- **Scenario 1: System Initialization and Robot/Environment Loading**. The user starts the control interface and the simulation environment. The simulation loads a 3D model of a robotic arm into a virtual world. The control interface establishes a connection with the simulation and displays the initial state of the robot.
- **Scenario 2: Manual Control of the Robotic Arm**. The user utilizes the control interface to manually jog the joints of the robotic arm. The control commands are sent to the simulation in real-time, and the user observes the updated robot pose in the simulation.
- **Scenario 3: Automated Path Execution**. The user defines a sequence of target poses for the robotic arm. The control system calculates a trajectory and sends a stream of commands to the simulation to execute the path. The simulation visualizes the robot moving along the planned trajectory.
- **Scenario 4: Fault Detection and Response**. The simulation detects a collision between the robotic arm and an obstacle in the environment. It sends a fault signal to the control system, which halts the robot’s motion and alerts the user.

### 2.5 Constraints
The development and execution of the system are subject to the following constraints:  
- **Platform Constraint:** The system must run on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.  
- **Programming Languages:** The implementation shall use **C/C++**.  
- **Concurrency:** Multithreading must rely on **POSIX threads (pthreads)**.  
- **Middleware:** All communication between components must use **ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco**.

## 4. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) provides a clear correspondence between each system requirement and the operational scenarios in which it is applied. This ensures full coverage, consistency, and validation of system functionality from a user and stakeholder perspective. Each requirement is mapped to one or more operational scenarios that describe the context of its use, as well as to the stakeholder(s) responsible for or affected by its implementation.

| Requirement ID | Operational Scenario(s) | Stakeholder(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REQ-F-001** | Scenario 1: System Initialization and Robot/Environment Loading | End-User (Hypothetical) |
| **REQ-F-002** | Scenario 1: System Initialization and Robot/Environment Loading | End-User (Hypothetical) |
